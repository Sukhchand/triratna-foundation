              <p>The corporation shall be governed by a Board of Directors, which shall have all the rights, powers, privileges, and limitations of liability of directors of a non-profit corporation organized under the Non-Profit Corporation Act of Nebraska. The Board shall establish policies and directives governing the corporation's business and programs and shall delegate to the Executive Leaders, Executive Director, and corporation Officers/staff, subject to these Bylaws' provisions, authority, and responsibility the policies and directives are appropriately followed.</p>
              <p>The corporation shall be governed by a Board of Directors, which shall have all the rights, powers, privileges, and limitations of liability of directors of a non-profit corporation organized under the Non-Profit Corporation Act of Nebraska. The Board shall establish policies and directives governing the corporation's business and programs and shall delegate to the Executive Leaders, Executive Director, and corporation Officers/staff, subject to these Bylaws' provisions, authority, and responsibility the policies and directives are appropriately followed.</p>
              <p>The Board shall have up to 21 members as required, but no fewer than three (3) Board members. The number of Board members may be increased beyond 21 members by the affirmative vote of a simple majority of the then-serving Board of Directors. The Board shall receive no compensation other than for reasonable expenses. However, provided the compensation structure complies with Sections relating to "Contracts Involving Board Members and Officers" as stipulated under these Bylaws, nothing in these Bylaws shall be construed to preclude any Board member from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation for services rendered. </p>
              <p>The Board's regular meetings may be held at such time and place as determined by the Board. The Chairperson of the Board or any three regular Board members may call a special meeting of the Board with three days written notice provided to each member of the Board. The notice shall be served upon each Board member via hand delivery, regular mail, email, or fax. The person(s) authorized to call such special meetings of the Board may also establish the place the gathering is to be conducted, so long as it is a proper place to hold any special meeting of the Board.</p>
              <p>At each meeting of the Board of Directors or Board Committees, the presence of a simple majority of the number of board members at the time of the meeting shall constitute a quorum for a business transaction. If the Board consists of an even number of members and the vote results in a tie, then the vote of the Chairperson of the Board shall be the deciding vote. The act of the majority of the Board members serving on the Board or Board Committees and present at a meeting in which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board or Board Committees unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or a law explicitly requiring otherwise. If a quorum is not present at a meeting, the Board members may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum shall be present. However, a Board member shall be considered present at any meeting of the Board or Board Committees if they are present via telephone or web conferencing with the other Board members participating in the discussion.</p>
