            Officers" as stipulated under these Bylaws, nothing in these Bylaws shall be construed to preclude any Board
            member from serving the Corporation/Organization in any other capacity and receiving compensation for
            services rendered.

          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Vacancies</h5>
          <p>
            A vacancy on the Board of Directors may exist at the occurrence of the following conditions:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            1). The death, resignation, or removal of any director.<br>

            2). The declaration by resolution of the Board of a vacancy in the office of a director who has been
            declared
            of unsound mind by a final order of court, convicted of a felony, found by final order or judgment of any
            court to have breached a duty pursuant to the Corporation Code and/or Act of the law dealing with the
            standards of conduct for a director, or has missed three consecutive meetings of the Board of Directors, or
            a total of four meetings of the Board during any one calendar year.<br>

            3). An increase in the authorized number of directors or<br>

            4). The failure of the directors, at any annual or other meeting of directors at which director(s) are to be
            elected, to elect the full authorized number of directors.<br>

          <p>
            The Board of Directors, by way of affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then currently in office,
            may remove any director without cause at any regular or special meeting, provided that the director to be
            removed has been notified in writing in the manner set forth in Article 5. Meetings that such action would
            be considered at the meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except as provided in this paragraph, any director may resign effective upon giving written notice to the
            chairperson of the Board, the Executive Director of Corporation/Organization, the secretary of
            Corporation/Organization, or the Board of Directors, unless the notice specifies a later time for the
            effectiveness of the resignation. If the resignation is effective at a future time, a successor may be
            designated to take office when the resignation becomes effective. Unless the Attorney General of Nebraska is
            first notified, no director may resign when the Corporation/Organization would then be left without a duly
            elected director in charge of its affairs. Any vacancy on the Board may be filled by executive head of the
            directors then in office, whether or not the number of directors then in office is less than a quorum, or by
            vote of a sole remaining director. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect
            of removing any director before that director's term of office expires.
          </p>
          <p>
            A Board member elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor
            in office.

            Each Board member shall have the right to resign at any time upon written notice thereof to the Chairperson
            of the Board, Secretary of the Board, or the Executive Director. Unless otherwise specified in the notice,
            the resignation shall take effect upon receipt thereof, and the acceptance of such resignation shall take
            effect upon receipt thereof, and the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it
            effective.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Removal</h5>
          <p>

            Chairperson of the Board or any three regular Board members may call a special meeting of the Board with
            Three Daysdays' written notice provided to each member of the Board. The notice shall be served upon each
            Board member via hand delivery, regular mail, email, or fax. The person(s) authorized to call such special
            meetings of the Board may also establish the place the meeting is to be conducted, so long as it is a
            reasonable place to hold any special meeting of the Board.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Minutes</h5>
          <p>
            The Secretary shall be responsible for the recording of all minutes of each and every meeting of the Board
            in which business shall be transacted in such order as the Board may determine from time to time. However,
            in the event that the Secretary is unavailable, the Chairperson of the Board shall appoint an individual to
            act as Secretary at the meeting. The Secretary, or the individual appointed to act as Secretary, shall
            prepare the minutes of the meetings, which shall be delivered to the Corporation/Organization to be placed
            in the minute books. A copy of the minutes shall be delivered to each Board member via either regular mail,

          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Action by Written Consent</h5>
          <p>
            Any action required by law to be taken at a meeting of the Board, or any action that may be taken at a
            meeting of the Board, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing setting forth the action so taken
            shall be signed by all Board members. The number of directors in office must constitute a quorum for an
            action taken by written consent. Such consent shall be placed in the minute book of the
            Corporation/Organization and shall have the same force and effect as a vote of the Board taken at an actual
            meeting. The Board members' written consent may be executed in multiple counterparts or copies, each of
            which shall be deemed an original for all purposes. In addition, facsimile signatures and electronic
            signatures or other electronic "consent click" acknowledgments shall be effective as original signatures.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Quorum</h5>
          <p>
            At each meeting of the Board of Directors or Board Committees, the presence of simple majority of the number
            of board members at the time of meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If at any
            time the Board consists of an even number of members and a vote results in a tie, then the vote of the
            Chairperson of the Board shall be the deciding vote. The act of the majority of the Board members serving on
            the Board or Board Committees and present at a meeting in which there is a quorum shall be the act of the
            Board or Board Committees, unless otherwise provided by the Articles of Incorporation, these Bylaws, or a
            law specifically requiring otherwise. If a quorum is not present at a meeting, the Board members present may
            adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice until a quorum shall be present. However, a
            Board member shall be considered present at any meeting of the Board or Board Committees if during the
            meeting he or she is present via telephone or web conferencing with the other Board members participating in
            the meeting.
          </p>
          <h5>Voting</h5>
          <p>
            Each Board member shall only have one vote.
          </p>
          <h5>Proxy</h5>
          <p>
            Members of the Board shall not be allowed to vote by written proxy.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Board Member Attendance</h5>
          <p>
            An elected Board Member who is absent from three consecutive regular meetings of the Board during a fiscal
            year shall be encouraged to reevaluate with the Chairperson of the Board his/her commitment to the
            Corporation/Organization. The Board may deem a Board member who has missed three consecutive meetings
            without such a reevaluation with the Chairperson to have resigned from the Board.

          <p>
            The Board of Directors may, from time to time, and by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then
            in office provided that a quorum is present, designate one or more committees to exercise all or a portion
            of the authority of the Board, to the extent of the powers specifically delegated in the resolution of the
            Board or in these Bylaws. Each such committee shall consist of at least two (2) directors, and may also
            include persons who are not on the Board but whom the directors believe to be reliable and competent to
            serve at the specific committee. However, committees exercising any authority of the Board of Directors may
            not have any non-director members. The Board may designate one or more alternative members of any committee
            who may replace any absent member at any meeting of the committee. The appointment of members or alternate
            members of a committee requires the vote of a majority of the directors then in office, provided that a
            quorum is present. The Board of Directors may also designate one or more advisory committees that do not
            have the authority of the Board. However, no committee, regardless of Board resolution, may:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            1). Approve of any action that, pursuant to applicable Law, would also require the affirmative vote of the
            members of the Board if this were a membership vote.<br>

            2). Fill vacancies on, or remove the members of, the Board of Directors or any committee that has the
            authority of the Board.<br>

            3). Fix compensation of the directors serving on the Board or on any committee.<br>

            4). Amend or repeal the Articles of Incorporation or bylaws or adopt new bylaws.<br>

            or repealable.<br>

            6). Appoint any other committees of the Board of Directors or their members.<br>

            7). Approve a plan of merger, consolidation, voluntary dissolution, bankruptcy, or reorganization; or a plan
            for the sale, lease, or exchange of all or considerably all of the property and assets of the
            Corporation/Organization otherwise than in the usual and regular course of its business; or revoke any such
            plan.<br>

            meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the Board of Directors. Notice of special
            meetings of committees shall also be given to any and all alternate members, who shall have the right to
            attend all meetings of the committee. Minutes shall be kept of each meeting of any committee and shall be
            filed with the Corporation/Organization records. The Board of Directors may adopt rules not consistent with
            the provisions of these bylaws for the governance of any committee.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a director relies on information prepared by a committee of the Board on which the director does not

            A director shall perform all the duties of a director, including, but not limited to, duties as a member of
            any committee of the Board on which the director may serve, in such a manner as the director deems to be in
            the best interest of the Corporation/Organization and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an
            ordinary, prudent, and reasonable person in a similar situation may exercise under similar circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the performance of the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information,
            opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each case
            prepared or presented by:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            1). One or more officers or employees of the Corporation/Organization whom the director deems to be reliable
            and competent in the matters presented.<br>

            2). Counsel, independent accountants, or other persons, as to the matters which the director deems to be
            within such person's professional or expert competence or <br>

            3). A committee of the Board upon which the director does not serve, as to matters within its designated
            authority, which committee the director deems to merit confidence,<br>
          </p>
          <p>
            so long as in any such case the director acts in good faith, after reasonable inquiry when the need may be
            indicated by the circumstances, and without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Except as herein provided in Article 8 - Standard of Care, any person who performs the duties of a director
            in accordance with the above shall have no liability based upon any failure or alleged failure to discharge
            that person's obligations as a director, including, without limitation of the following, any actions or
            omissions which exceed or defeat a public or charitable purpose to which the Corporation/Organization, or

          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Loans</h5>

            The Corporation/Organization shall not make any loan of money or property to, or guarantee the obligation

            subsidiary for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of such
            officer or director so long as such individual would be entitled to be reimbursed for such expenses absent
            that advance.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Conflict of Interest</h5>
          <p>
            The purpose of the Conflict-of-Interest policy is to protect the Corporation/Organization's interest when it
            is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of one
            of its officers or directors, or that might otherwise result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This
            policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of
            interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable corporations/organizations and is not intended as an
            exclusive statement of responsibilities.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Restriction on Interested Directors</h5>
          <p>
            Not more than Maximum Percentage of Board% (percent) of the persons serving on the Board of Directors at any
            time may be interested persons. An interested person is (1) any person currently being compensated by the
            Corporation/Organization for services rendered to it within the previous twelve (12) months, whether as a
            full-time or part-time employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, excluding any reasonable compensation
            paid to a director; and (2) any brother, sister, parent, ancestor, descendent, spouse, brother-in-law,
            sister-in-law, son-in-law, mother-in-law, or father-in-law of any such person. However, any violation of the
            provisions of this section shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any transaction entered into
            by the interested person.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Duty to Disclose</h5>
          <p>
            In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the
            existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the
            directors who are considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Establishing a Conflict of Interest</h5>
          <p>
            After the disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the
            interested person, the interested person shall leave the Board meeting while the potential conflict of
            interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining Board members shall decide if a conflict of interest
            exists.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Addressing a Conflict of Interest</h5>
          <p>
            In the event that the Board should establish that a proposed transaction or arrangement establishes a
            conflict of interest, the Board shall then proceed with the following actions:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            a) Any interested person may render a request or report at the Board meeting, but upon completion of said
            request or report the individual shall be excused while the Board discusses the information and/or material
            presented and then votes on the transaction or arrangement proposed involving the possible conflict of
            interest.<br>

            b) The Chairman of the Board of the Board shall, if deemed necessary and appropriate, appoint a
            disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction or
            arrangement.<br>

            c) After exercising due diligence, the Board shall determine whether the Corporation/Organization can obtain
            with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would
            not give rise to a conflict of interest.<br>

            d) If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not
            producing a conflict of interest, the Board shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested
            directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the best interest of the Corporation/Organization,
            for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. It shall make its decision as to whether to
            enter into the transaction arrangement in conformity with this determination.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Violations of Conflict of Interest Policy</h5>
          <p>
            Should the Board have reasonable cause to believe an interested person has failed to disclose actual or
            possible conflicts of interest, the Board shall then inform the interested person of the basis for such
            belief and afford the interested person an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
          </p>
          <p>
            If, after hearing the interested person's explanation, and after making further investigation as may be
            warranted in consideration of the circumstances, the Board determines the interested person intentionally
            failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and
            corrective action.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Procedures and Records</h5>
          <p>
            All minutes of the Board Meetings, when applicable, shall contain the following information:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            1). The names of all the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in
            connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action
            taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Board's decision as to whether a
            conflict of interest in fact existed.<br>

            2). The names of the persons who were present for discussions and any votes relating to the transaction or
            arrangement, the content of the discussions, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or
            arrangement, and a record of any vote taken in connection with the proceedings.

            Each director, principal officer, and member of a committee with Board delegated powers shall be required to
            sign a statement which affirms that such person:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            1) Has received a copy of the conflict-of-interest policy;<br>

            2) Has read and understands the policy;<br>

            3) Has agreed to comply with the policy; and <br>

            4) Understands that the Corporation/Organization is charitable, and in order to maintain its federal tax
            exemption, it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.

          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Violation of Loyalty - Self-Dealing Contracts</h5>
          <p>
            A self-dealing contract is any contract or transaction (i) between this Corporation/Organization and one or
            more of its Directors, or between this Corporation/Organization and any corporation, firm, or association in
            which one or more of the Directors has a material financial interest ("Interested Director"), or (ii)
            between this Corporation/Organization and a corporation, firm, or association of which one or more of its
            directors are Directors of this Corporation/Organization. Said self-dealing shall not be void or voidable
            because such Director(s) of corporation, firm, or association are parties or because said Director(s) are
            present at the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee which authorizes, approves or ratifies the
            self-dealing contract, if:
          </p>
          <p style="margin-left: 10px;">
            1) All material facts are fully disclosed to or otherwise known by the members of the Board and the
            self-dealing contract is approved by the Interested Director in good faith (without including the vote of
            any membership owned by said interested Director(s));<br>

            2) All material facts are fully disclosed to or otherwise known by the Board of Directors or committee, and
            the Board of Directors or committee authorizes, approves, or ratifies the self-dealing contract in good
            faith without counting the vote of the interest Director(s) and the contract is just and reasonable as to
            the Corporation/Organization at the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified; or<br>

            3) As to contracts not approved as provided in above sections (a) and/or (b), the person asserting the
            validity of the self-dealing contract sustains the burden of proving that the contract was just and
            reasonable as to the Corporation/Organization at the time it was authorized, approved, or ratified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interested Director(s) may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of
            Directors or a committee thereof, which authorizes, approves, or ratifies a contract or transaction as
            provided for and contained in this section.
          </p>
          <h5 class="text-center">Indemnification</h5>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation/Organization shall indemnify its "agents," as
            described by law, including its directors, officers, employees and volunteers, and including persons
            formerly occupying any such position, and their heirs, executors and administrators, against all expenses,
            judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with
            any "proceeding," and including any action by or in the right of the Corporation/Organization, by reason of
            the fact that the person is or was a person as described in the Non-Profit Corporation Act. Such right of
            indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which such persons may be entitled apart
            from this Article.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, and, except as otherwise determined by the Board in a specific
            instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification in defending any "proceeding" shall be
            advanced by the Corporation/Organization of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person to repay such
            amount unless it is ultimately determined that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the
            Corporation/Organization for those expenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Corporation/Organization shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent
            of the Corporation/Organization, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any liability asserted
            against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such, or to give
            other indemnification to the extent permitted by law.

            belief and afford the interested person an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.

            failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and

          <h5 class="text-center">Honesty or Truthfulness</h5>         
         <p>    
          Honesty/truthfulness is one of the most well-known principles of ethical communication. To treat others the way you want back from them is a well-known belief in society. Proceeding like an open book is like addressing the concerns rather than sweeping the scatters underneath the rug. There are circumstances when we fail to unveil the truths, but it is still unethical to be judgmental and jump down to their throat with anger. There could be several reasons of love, gentleness, safety, security or confidentiality behind it, however, to advance happy and healthy connection and take your colleague out of the darkness, it’s significant, to be honest. The correct/precise communication with reason, dimension, calculation, or the exact value does occur under ethical communication category. Thus, doing what is right is better than what is comfortable. We should create and implement the ethical rules to make the team members follow the proper actions.

        <h5 class="text-center">Respect Privacy and Confidentiality</h5>
        <p>
          The safeguarding of privacy and confidentiality is crucial to conserve the trust-connection amongst the leader and the followers. We manage a high level of confidentiality of any private information or will have a fair contract with the information owner before communicating their information to others unless required by the law. We trash the records and data in accordance, with the law of the state in which they practice, and in a manner that permits by the standards of ethics and integrity. The oral reporting of someone’s personal information, health information, disposing images is unethical and the violation of privacy law. For instance, we are required to keep personal information of our clients like address, phone number, social security number, and date of birth confidential. Communicating such personal information to the public results crimes in society. It could be withdrawing money from the banks, scams and so on. Our leaders will accurately identify the position of others and make only true and positive public statements.
        </p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Conflict of Interest</h5>
         <p>
          Conflicts of interest is a situation in which an individual or corporation (either private or governmental) is in a position to misuse a professional or official capacity in some way for their personal or corporate benefit. We seek to avoid any communication related to conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest and not openly disclose any such matters to the public. We remove ourselves away from communications when such a situation arises. We will not knowingly communicate any personal, professional or monetary advantage or benefit to the leader-client relationship, besides by a form of compensation as allowed in the agreement or contract. The violation of this standard may leave us subject to legal action.
         </p>
         <h5 class="text-center">Condemn Unethical Communications</h5>
         <p>
          As leaders, we will not purposely miscommunicate or make false statements to the supporters. We will not give any misleading or false pledges to our supporters.We will have contracts with the employees and honor all agreements made in the context of professional relationships before any communication made. Right at the beginning, we will carefully explain the nature of the relationship, and any other terms or conditions. The negative impact in the organization is the result of unethical corporate communications. Weare accountable for setting clear, appropriate, and culturally sensitive information that govern any physical contacts we might have with our associates and will not communicate any sex-related conversations with the employees. 
         </p>
         <h5 class="text-center">Religious and Cultural Tolerance</h5>
         <p>
          The ability to appreciate other’s spiritual and cultural values, beliefs, and practices are important. The goal of this Triratna Foundation, Inc., is to construct unity in the diversity of religion and culture. There is no universal standard of moral rightness or wrongness in the world because of the diversified nature of religion and culture. On this regard, understanding is the chief method that might help a leader to determine what to speak or not. We promote religious tolerance and focus on humanity linked with religion, culture, holiness, and well-being. Research suggests that ethical leadership is related positively to many follower outcomes. All the leadersneed a basic knowledge of major religions and cultures of the world. When we communicate with others, we shouldn’t speak against the culture and religion of our opponent. This kind of awareness helps to keep the parties away from the unethical conversation. 
         </p>
         <h5 class="text-center">Other Ethical Communication</h5>
         <p>
          There are communication ethics that are equally important for us to remember. They are freedom of expression, respect to others’ communication, the well-being of the families, communities, and society, promote fairness and justice, share information and opinions, and to take the responsibility of our private communication. Everyone has rights to the freedom of expression and opinions without any interference and to deliver information and ideas through any existing media. We have no rights to stop anyone from expressing their opinion. We will respect the communication of others and will not resist. We are expected to be kind to individuals, families, communities, and society as a whole. Biasness is an unethical practice of communication, and it is therefore assumed fairness and justice from the leader. Sharing information and opinions is so significant because we are expected to keep the employees informed about the progress of the company confidentially. Last but not least, ethical beings take the responsibilities of all the consequences of his communication.
