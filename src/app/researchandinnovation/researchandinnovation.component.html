          Triratna Foundation (TF) supports and promotes research and innovation projects associated with the
          corporation's vision and mission. We aim to promote scientific research on neuroscience related to the brain,
          behavior, mind, and spirituality. It commits to easing the suffering caused by mental illness. The research
          will focus on using minds to realize greater happiness, love, and wisdom. They will contribute to stimulating
          and strengthening our brain for more fulfilling relationships, a deeper spiritual life, and a greater sense of
          inner confidence and worth. Besides, we'll work on stimulating the brain states of calm, joy, and compassion
          instead of worry, sorrow, and violence.
