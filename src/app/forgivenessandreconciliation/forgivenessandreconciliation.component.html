                    Transgressions occur between individuals, and the actions of the individuals resolve conflict (Eaton, 2011). The offender apologizes, the victim forgives, and the relationship is restored. Such theories are applied to war at the intergroup level to restore peace after international, international, social, religious, or interethnic conflict. Triratna Foundation considers forgiveness and reconciliation as the primary pathway to conflict management and peace-building in the context of interpersonal and intergroup transgressions, with a specific focus on the self's role. How does one promote forgiveness when the violence is ongoing and is both episodic and structural when the perpetrators (who carry it out) have not acknowledged the harm done? When our religious teachings are sometimes at odds with our desire for peace? We'll carry out case studies from frontline associates and illustrate the need for forgiveness and reconciliation in situations where mass destruction has occurred.

                    There are proposed models of the forgiveness process and practical techniques for promoting forgiveness and reconciliation in a peacekeeping context, ranging from restorative justice initiatives to a therapeutic art program. When dealing with conflict that is rooted in a cultural and historical context, such as the fact that hatred and animosity are often passed down to subsequent generations, that sometimes there is no agreement on who is the victim and who is the offender, and that the concept of forgiveness may be understood differently by different cultures. Besides, there are situations when the offender does not apologize or accept responsibility; although forgiveness may be possible, reconciliation is not. Nevertheless, Triratna Foundation will take significant leadership on practical peace-building efforts through the forgiveness and reconciliation approach.
